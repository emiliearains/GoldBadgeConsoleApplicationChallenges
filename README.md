### Challenge One

 Komodo cafe is getting a new menu and the manager wants to be able to create new menu items, update menu items, delete menu items, and receive a list of all items on the cafe's menu. She needs a console app.

Menu Items: number, name, description, list of ingredients, price.

Task:
- Create a Menu Class with properties, constructors, and fields.
- Create a MenuRepository Class that has methods needed.
- Create a Test Class for your repository methods. 
- Create a Program file that allows the cafe manager to add, delete, and see all items in the menu list.

### Challenge Six
Komodo Insurance is trying to add a Green Plan for their customers that provides incentives for owning an Electric or Hybrid car. Before they are able to configure any pricing or deals, they want to collect general information on Electric, Hybrid, and Gas cars so that they can do various comparisons.

The purpose of the app:
collect, read, delete, and update data on gas, electric, and hybrid cars.

### Challenge Three
Komodo Insurance is fixing their badging system.

They need:
An app that maintains a dictionary of details about employee badge information. 

The Program will allow a security staff member to do the following:
- create a new badge
- update doors on an existing badge.
- delete all doors from an existing badge.
- show a list with all badge numbers and door access
(Keep the responsibilities of your UI, your repo, and your tests separate.
Only your UI class should ever take input from the user.)

Out of scope:
No need to consider tying an individual badge to a particular user. Just the Badge # will do.

Unit Test Repository methods.
